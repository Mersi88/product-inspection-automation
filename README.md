# Inspection Data Analysis & Dashboard (Flask)

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow using Python. It starts with raw inspection data, performs data cleaning and exploratory analysis using Pandas, and exposes the results through a lightweight Flask web application with a simple interactive dashboard.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical skills across:
data preprocessing → analysis → backend API → frontend visualization.
